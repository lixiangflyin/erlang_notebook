This is an JSON/HTTP API using Cowboy and JSX intended to be the template for modeling a REST API.

erlang_notebook_gen_server

Perhaps one of the most commonly used behaviors in the OTP suite, this is a gen_server template for handing messages and state.

erlang_notebook_mnesia_db
---

A simple implementation of an application that uses the Mnesia database provided with Erlang.

erlang_notebook_nif
---

An Erlang library written in C using Erlang C header files.

erlang_notebook_web
